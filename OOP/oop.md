C++ supports Object Oriented Programming, and classes and objects are the heart of this programming paradigm.

ï»¿C++ has various built in types (like bool, int, floats, and so on). Each of these types has various features (for example, the size of their memory occupancy). Operators have different meanings for each different type.

For example: The '+' operator  adds ints, floats, and doubles:
```
int x = 5;
int y = 6;

int z= x+y;//z==11
```
However if we use the '+' operator with strings, it concatenates those strings.
```
string s1 = "alptekin";
string s2 = "karabacak";
```

```
string s3=s1+s2;//s3 will be alptekin karabacak
```
Here, x, y, and z represent an integer, while s1, s2, and s3 represent strings. So x, y, and z are objects of type int. Meanwhile s1, s2, and s3 are objects of type string.

Note: don't confuse this with the word 'Object'. An object is anything that occupies memory.

But what if we want to have a type that represents objects in our daily life? How could you represent a house, a car, books, animals, and so on? This is why we need Classes.

A class is a user defined type. This means that you can define your own types. You can make your own types like ints, floats, and chars. You can define operators for your types and set various properties for your own types.

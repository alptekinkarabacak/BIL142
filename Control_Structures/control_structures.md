If Statement / If Condition
In computer programming, we use the if...else statement to run one block of code under certain conditions and another block of code under different conditions.

For example, assigning grades (A, B, C) based on marks obtained by a student.
    if the percentage is above 90, assign grade A
    if the percentage is above 75, assign grade B
    if the percentage is above 65, assign grade C
    
There are three forms of if...else statements in C++.

    if statement
    if...else statement
    if...else if...else statement


Basic Syntax:
```
if (condition) {
  // body of if statement
}
```





Syntax is: if (condition) 
{
// these Codes will run if "condition" return true.
}
else if (Another condition)
{
// these Codes will run if  "Another condition" return true.
}
else
{
// these Codes will run if any condition does not return true.
}


```
int a = pow(2,32);
std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
std::cout<<a<<"\n";
std::cout<<std::numeric_limits<int>::max()<<"\n";
```
